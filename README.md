# Script to Retrieve Combotickets from the TICKeos API

In Germany, many Verkehrsverbünde offer so-called "Kombitickets" to event organisers which allows these event organisers
to sell a ticket for public transport together with the ticket for admission. This repository contains a script to retrieve
the public transport ticket to be included in a event ticket from the "TICKeos" API. It is useful if your ticket sales system is not able
to retrieve the tickets itself.
